<h2>Lab5</h2>
In this lab, students work with classification algorithms like decision trees and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). The objective is to build models that can predict categorical outcomes based on input features. Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices are also covered.
